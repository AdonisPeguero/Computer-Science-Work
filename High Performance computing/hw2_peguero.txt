I tried every optimisation you mention in the sept 19 notes
and the only thing that made a big difference was deleting 
unnecessary arrays and combining similar arrays. 
The other optimization techniques actually made 
the program run slower. I compiled my program every time
I optimized something and every time I used icc -o0,-o1,-o2 
this come up: command line warning #10122: overriding '-o1' with '-ohw2_peguero'
I have no clue what this is, sent help.
